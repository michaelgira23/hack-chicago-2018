This project was created in 24 hours by a team of four people! Blake Abel, Jack Cai, Nick Clifford, and Michael Gira.

## CapShare

We created CapShare to finally have a good way to share the pictures that everyone wants to have. The graduation photos, the hackathon friends, and everything in between. Gone are the days of making a huge groupchat to send pictures or asking friends for pictures they took days ago!

CapShare is a location-based image sharing website. Accessible from all devices, and always only a few taps away, it's the perfect solution to never let another moment get lost in obscurity. Users go onto the site and see albums online near them, and are able to add to them (with a password protected option, of course!) with the push of a button.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development & Tools

### Dev server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build
